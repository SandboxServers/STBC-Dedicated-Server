# AGENTS.md

Agent operating guide for this repository.

## 1. Project Summary

This repo implements a headless dedicated server for Star Trek: Bridge Commander by proxying `ddraw.dll`.

- Core runtime: `src/proxy/*.c` (especially `src/proxy/ddraw_main.c`)
- Embedded scripting: Python 1.5.2 in `src/scripts/`
- Reverse-engineering references: `docs/`, `reference/decompiled/`, `reference/scripts/`
- Runtime game installs (gitignored): `game/server/`, `game/client/`, `game/stock-dedi/`

## 2. Multi-Agent Mandate (Non-Negotiable)

Single-persona analysis is not sufficient for this project. Use orchestrated specialist agents for all non-trivial work.

- The orchestrator owns planning, synthesis, code changes, and verification decisions.
- Specialist agents own research and analysis in their domains.
- Launch independent investigations in parallel whenever possible.
- Do not ship high-risk changes (protocol, crash, binary patch, bootstrap) without cross-agent corroboration.
- If only one specialist is available for a high-risk task, explicitly mark confidence as reduced and require stronger runtime validation before merge.

## 3. Core Specialist Roster

Use these specialist roles (mapped to available skills/agents):

- `game-reverse-engineer`: decompilation, function/xref tracing, handler-path discovery
- `network-protocol-analyst`: packet-flow decode, opcode sequencing, disconnect diagnosis
- `win32-crash-analyst`: crash dump triage, register/stack interpretation
- `x86-patch-engineer`: x86-32 patch design, caves/detours/calling convention safety
- `python-152-reviewer`: strict Python 1.5.2 compatibility and SWIG usage review
- `netimmerse-engine-dev`: NetImmerse pipeline/object-lifecycle reasoning
- `stbc-original-dev`: original design intent and behavior sanity checks

## 4. Required Orchestration Workflow

### 4.1 Intake

- Define the failure or feature target with concrete evidence.
- Identify impacted subsystems (`proxy`, `network`, `python`, `engine`, `ui`).
- Select the minimal specialist set that covers uncertainty.

### 4.2 Parallel Investigation

For each selected specialist, request:

- hypothesis
- evidence with exact references (file path, address, opcode, packet seq, log signature)
- confidence level
- proposed fix options and risk

Run specialist investigations in parallel if independent.

### 4.3 Synthesis Gate

Before editing code, produce a merged conclusion that includes:

- agreed root cause
- disagreements and why one interpretation wins
- chosen fix and rejected alternatives
- risk controls and verification plan

### 4.4 Implementation

- Orchestrator makes minimal, targeted edits.
- Preserve existing architecture and patch style.
- Avoid speculative refactors.

### 4.5 Verification

- Validate runtime behavior with logs/traces.
- Require at least one independent specialist review for high-risk fixes before considering task complete.

## 5. Minimum Agent Sets by Task Type

- Crash triage/AV/VEH/SEH: `win32-crash-analyst` + `game-reverse-engineer` + `x86-patch-engineer`
- Packet flow/disconnect/handshake: `network-protocol-analyst` + `game-reverse-engineer` + `stbc-original-dev`
- Headless renderer/NetImmerse lifecycle issues: `netimmerse-engine-dev` + `game-reverse-engineer`
- Python script behavior changes: `python-152-reviewer` + relevant domain specialist (`network-protocol-analyst` or `stbc-original-dev`)
- Binary patch design/update: `x86-patch-engineer` + `game-reverse-engineer` (+ `win32-crash-analyst` for crash-driven patches)

## 6. Evidence Standards

No high-impact claim without provenance. Cite concrete artifacts:

- logs: `ddraw_proxy.log`, `packet_trace.log`, `dedicated_init.log`, `crash_dump.log`, `client_debug.log`
- references: `reference/decompiled/*`, protocol docs, architecture docs
- runtime comparison: stock-dedi vs dedicated traces

For protocol or handler assertions, require at least two of:

1. packet-trace evidence
2. decompiled handler-path evidence
3. stock-dedi behavioral baseline

## 7. Build, Run, and Validation Workflow

There is no automated test suite. Required validation is runtime/log based.

### 7.1 Build

```bash
make build
make build-observe
```

Build-system note:

- `src/proxy/ddraw_main.c` is split into include-components in `src/proxy/ddraw_main/*.inc.c`.
- `Makefile` tracks these via `DDRAW_MAIN_PARTS`; keep that dependency in place when editing build rules.
- If incremental behavior looks wrong (e.g., expected C changes but stale binary behavior), run `make clean` then rebuild to confirm.

### 7.2 Deploy/Run

```bash
make deploy-server
make deploy-client
make run-server
make run-client
make run-stockdedi
```

### 7.3 Validate

1. Build succeeds (`make build` / `make build-observe`)
2. Relevant deploy target succeeds
3. Repro flow is exercised (typically Multiplayer LAN join)
4. Logs/traces confirm expected behavior and no obvious regressions

At minimum inspect:

- `game/server/ddraw_proxy.log`
- `game/server/packet_trace.log`
- `game/server/dedicated_init.log`
- `game/server/crash_dump.log` (if crash)
- `game/client/client_debug.log` (for client-path issues)

Use:

```bash
make logs-server
make logs-client
make logs-stockdedi
```

## 8. Python 1.5.2 Constraints (Strict)

All Python in `src/scripts/` must remain Python 1.5.2 compatible.

- Use `print "x"`, not `print("x")`
- Use `except Exception, e:`, not `except Exception as e:`
- No list comprehensions, ternaries, f-strings, modern syntax
- Do not use `key in dict`; use `dict.has_key(key)`
- For substring checks use `strop.find(s, sub) >= 0`
- Closures are unreliable; use default-arg capture
- SWIG API is functional (`App.Class_Method(obj, ...)`)

After Python edits, ensure `.pyc` cache is not stale (deploy targets clean these).

## 9. Binary Patch and C-Side Safety

When editing `src/proxy/ddraw_main.c` or other proxy C files:

- Preserve calling conventions and stack discipline.
- Keep patches localized and reversible.
- Prefer explicit guards (NULL/vtable checks) over silent behavior changes.
- Avoid heavy/blocking work in timer/update hot paths.
- Do not change hardcoded addresses without direct evidence.

For protocol behavior changes, validate against stock behavior using `game/stock-dedi/` observer traces.

## 10. File Guidance

Primary edit targets:

- `src/proxy/ddraw_main.c`
- `src/proxy/ddraw_ddraw7.c`
- `src/proxy/ddraw_d3d7.c`
- `src/proxy/ddraw_surface7.c`
- `src/scripts/Custom/DedicatedServer.py`
- `src/scripts/Local.py`
- `src/scripts/ClientLocal.py`
- `docs/*.md`

Reference-only unless explicitly needed:

- `reference/decompiled/*`
- `reference/scripts/*`

Do not hand-edit runtime game installs except explicit local debugging:

- `game/server/*`
- `game/client/*`
- `game/stock-dedi/*`

Use deploy targets instead of manual copying.

## 11. Symptom-Driven Triage Order

- Boot failure: `ddraw_proxy.log` -> `dedicated_init.log` -> `crash_dump.log`
- Connect/disconnect: server/client `packet_trace.log` correlation -> `client_debug.log`
- Crash: `crash_dump.log` first, then proxy timeline
- Protocol drift: compare `game/server/packet_trace.log` with `game/stock-dedi/packet_trace.log`

## 12. Definition of Done

A task is complete when:

1. Requested code/docs changes are implemented
2. Relevant build/deploy flow succeeds (or blocker is explicit)
3. Runtime/log validation confirms intended behavior
4. Multi-agent evidence is synthesized and recorded for high-risk changes
5. Remaining risks and follow-ups are explicitly documented

## 13. Key References

- `README.md`
- `docs/developer-workflow.md`
- `docs/architecture-overview.md`
- `docs/troubleshooting.md`
- `docs/python-152-guide.md`
- `docs/dedicated-server.md`
- `docs/wire-format-spec.md`
- `docs/black-screen-investigation.md`
- `docs/empty-stateupdate-root-cause.md`

If behavior is unclear, verify with decompiled references and stock-dedi traces before patching.
